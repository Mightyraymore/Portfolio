			<h3>Why Software Development?</h3>
			<p>I began professionally as a black-box tester at Citibank in 2012. 
			It was a great feeling to be a part of team. The most fulfilling aspect of working in a team, was 
			finding a solution to challenging problems. It’s always, helpful working with others and bouncing 
			ideas off of one another. Sometimes that is not possible and that is when sniffing around on the Web 
			is great also.</p>
			
			<p>It was a privilege emerging myself into learning about credit card processes in the scope of banking.
			One of the most fascinating things about software development, is planning how the software should 
			behave and how all the different classes of code interact with different objects. It takes a lot of 
			planning, to bring together a hundred different people, to play different roles in such projects.</p>
			
			<p>When it comes to software, it is constantly changing and you never just become rooted to one thing. 
			Perhaps this is the very reason I feel compelled to be in this profession, because of all the new 
			things that I learn on my journeys. Along the way I have been inspired by different people, weather 
			they are project managers, developers, testers, or stakeholders. These are the reasons I love what I 
			do and continue in this arena.</p>
			
			<h3>Why Software Testing?</h3>
			<p>Software testing is crucial to the success of meeting the needs and requirements of the 
			consumer who uses it. Without testing, I could just imagine the scenarios where the development team could 
			be embarrassed with broken software especially when hours, days, weeks and even months of work come to a 
			grinding halt. An example, if code written 2 months down the road and is causing unexpected things to happen 
			to other aspects of the software. All sorts of issues would likely occur. There would be serious risks and 
			consequences to the budget and schedule of that project.</p>

			<p>It’s fun to learn about what the consumer expects, and learn about their needs. The 
			responsibility to create test case scenarios is interesting, because the challenge of finding creative 
			ways to test against those rules can be broad. It’s also my job to break the rules, or at least try. How 
			many jobs or careers can people have that luxury, after all?

			<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
			<p>I spend most of my time exploring java on my Spring Tool editor. One of the projects I spent time 
			learning about was spring boot projects, incorporating Model View Control (MVC). I toyed around with the 
			ecommerce website. I built a number of things such as; a side menu with sliders to select price ranges, 
			checkboxes, and filters. I also included a rating section in the side menu.
			</p>

			<p>I created cards with product image and buttons for viewing description and ratings. MYSQL added to 
			store product data, customer data, shopping and cart data.I wrote Java Script to perform a number of functions, 
			that handle ways cards or products are used. I created a login page to authenticate users and administrators. 
			It was fun learning, and developing my project.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Video Gaming</h3>
			<p>Growing up, I remember first playing Atari. I played games like Pitfall and Pong. When Nintendo came 
			out I enjoyed games such as; Mario Brothers, Pac-Man, Dragon Warrior Legend of Zelda. Sega Genesis gaming console 
			came out in my teen years. Sega reminds me of the hours I spent playing Sonic the Hedgehog.
			</p>
			
			<p>After PlayStation was released, I became a huge fan of the Final Fantasy games. I remember my first 
			Final Fantasy game, Final Fantasy 7. The story line read like an amazing book. Graphics blew pretty much any game I ever 
			played out of the water. When Final Fantasy 11 online came out, it was the first Multiplayer Roleplaying Online, that I 
			played.</P> 
			
			<P>I spent 8 years of my life playing it. Playing Final Fantasy 11 online, I made so many friends all over the world; 
			Germany, Japan and Australia. It was a great time joining and making large teams, for a variety of events, in the game. 
			This is where my love for software was realized. I attribute playing video games, for crossing the bridge into software 
			development.</p>

			<h3>My Education</h3>
			<p>At Colorado Technical University, I chose to begin my studies into software development. In 2010, I 
			began to earn my bachelor’s degree in software engineering. The way I viewed taking on this challenge, was to conquer my 
			fears of stepping into a domain I had never stepped in. I had the some of the best times pursuing this goal, in technologies
			in software engineering
			</p>

			<p>This was not a brick and mortar school, this was all online. We had challenges working together on 
			group assignments, which led to not only learning how to do projects as a team, but how to effectively organize and work 
			cohesively as one unit. Our courses were project based, so we had to research and read a variety of books to implement 
			our different projects. It was very heavy hands on learning, which is the best way I learn.</p>
